<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>When I started with my personal bike-track homepage at <a href="https://123k.org">123k.org</a> a few years ago I decided to put all my tracks
in a MongoDB. The model I use is very simple. I have a class <code>Route</code> which holds meta-data about the track
and a class <code>TrackPoint</code> which represents a point and has a foreign key to the respective track (of course).
After some years I have 612827 track-points. So 600k entries is not &lsquo;big-data&rsquo; exactly,
but it is too much to be displayed on a leaflet map at once. What I really wanted is a &lsquo;Coverage View&rsquo;, which just
shows me where I&rsquo;ve been with the bike.</p>

<h1 id="the-algorithm">The Algorithm</h1>

<p>As I start all of my rides at my home and eventually return there I have a center where to start the coverage.
From there I started the following algorithm.</p>

<script type="application/javascript" src="//gist.github.com/efwe/65e28c72c9948da0e9f8.js?file=coverage.rb"></script>

<p>It does 100m steps for 50km and selects all points in the area between min/max distance.</p>

<script type="application/javascript" src="//gist.github.com/efwe/675f2d2d56470933aaa5.js?file=hull_for.rb"></script>

<p>The trick is, that I only consider the points of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull">convex hull</a>.
I chose the Jarvis March algorithm as completely described <a href="http://tomswitzer.net/2009/12/jarvis-march/">here</a>.</p>

<p>This is very efficient, most of the points are not considered (A random output of my job is
<code>calculated hull polygon with 22 points from a total of 2217 points</code>). Finally I only have 12033 points left.
The resulting points are stored as one document in MongoDB.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">client <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">TrackPoint</span><span style="color:#f92672">.</span>mongo_client
client<span style="color:#f92672">[</span><span style="color:#e6db74">:coverage</span><span style="color:#f92672">].</span>drop()
