      <description>Introduction When I started with my personal bike-track homepage at 123k.org a few years ago I decided to put all my tracks in a MongoDB. The model I use is very simple. I have a class Route which holds meta-data about the track and a class TrackPoint which represents a point and has a foreign key to the respective track (of course). After some years I have 612827 track-points. So 600k entries is not &amp;lsquo;big-data&amp;rsquo; exactly, but it is too much to be displayed on a leaflet map at once.</description>
