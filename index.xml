      <title>Many Clickable Points on a Leaflet Map With Leaflet.glify</title>

      <description>Problem As seen in the post before we collected some 12.000 points which we want to display on a leaflet map. Every attempt to put that many points on one map failed. Firefox completely stopped working, chrome did a little bit better and stayed responsive, but that was not a solution at all.
Solution I pretty much tried everything L.geoJSON layer with points and polygons. Where polygons would have been a solution maybe, but you can not tell leaflet to just draw the corners of the polygons.</description>

      <title>Build a Coverage Map With Mongodb</title>

      <description>Introduction When I started with my personal bike-track homepage at 123k.org a few years ago I decided to put all my tracks in a MongoDB. The model I use is very simple. I have a class Route which holds meta-data about the track and a class TrackPoint which represents a point and has a foreign key to the respective track (of course). After some years I have 612827 track-points. So 600k entries is not &amp;lsquo;big-data&amp;rsquo; exactly, but it is too much to be displayed on a leaflet map at once.</description>

      <title>Show routes to current geohash</title>

      <description>The Plan My geohashing alert-system at 123k.org shows the current geohash for my home graticule. The plan is to the nearest route which passes by.
Finding Something As mentioned earlier I have all points i ever visited in a collection. This collection holds a geospatial index. Therefore I can issue mongo queries with the $nearSphere command. This command finds the first points from a given location.
 So this just works.</description>
