    <meta name="description" content="Welcome Back Obelometer
A few years ago I bought my first few raspberries and the first thing I invented
was (of course) a thermometer application. Back then I even
stored the data in MongoDB and calculated stuff with map-reduce - but
as one rpi died and the host server also was re-installed I never looked back.
During my recent rebuild of the home-office I found some old rpis and even the thermometer
and the wireless sticks. So I thought I should start one of them again.">

<p>A few years ago I bought my first few raspberries and the first thing I invented
was (of course) a thermometer application. Back then I even
stored the data in MongoDB and calculated stuff with map-reduce - but
as one rpi died and the host server also was re-installed I never looked back.</p>
<p>During my recent rebuild of the home-office I found some old rpis and even the thermometer
and the wireless sticks. So I thought I should start one of them again.</p>
<p><img src="/images/obelometer.png" alt="obelometer"></p>
<h2 id="event-source">Event Source</h2>
<p>So the event source for the obelometer is a node.js application called
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/efwe/cimon.git">cimon</a>. And instead of running my
own MQTT server i chose <a href="https://www.cloudmqtt.com">cloudmqtt</a> this time.
The other stuff was pretty much untouched - so small node projects with
few dependencies are aging well - not so bad :)</p>
<h2 id="thermometer-view">Thermometer View</h2>
<p>The one funny thing about the initial implementation was the
green bar-view rendered with <a href="https://github.com/nosir/obelisk.js/">obelisk.js</a>. This
view is now incorporated into my <a href="https://123k.work">123k.work</a> homepage as an
Experiment. This time I chose to directly access the MQTT server from the browser instead of
implementing an intermediate application (like the infamous <a href="https://github.com/efwe/teger">teger</a>).</p>
<h2 id="open-ends">Open Ends</h2>
<p>Right now the backend send messages around which are completely superflous because nobody is
listening (earlier there was this persistence-job which used every message really).
So for this scenario I would like to implement kind of a &lsquo;start-protocol&rsquo; for the backend.</p>
