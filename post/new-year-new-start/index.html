Hello there, I&rsquo;m Back in Business (jak EPMD!) -
only after three years of effective inactivity I decided to re-active this blog again.
As I really did not prepare any content 1 , I can only start with some small notes.
Disaster and Recovery
So in September 2018 I found out, that my server where the 123k project runs did not respond any more.
I went to the fabulous Hetzner site and found out, that it just does not boot
any more because of ZFS file system corruption.
This was not recoverable - I saved a snapshot of the whole thing. So if
some ZFS developer wants to know what happened to this special file system - you&rsquo;re welcome.
I myself did not investigate too much and just setup a new server (so I do not know if I was hacked or the underlying hypervisor had a hickup).">

<p>Hello there, I&rsquo;m <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldeerlh8_DA">Back in Business</a> (jak EPMD!) -
only after three years of effective inactivity I decided to re-active this blog again.
As I really did not prepare any content <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> , I can only start with some small notes.</p>
<h2 id="disaster-and-recovery">Disaster and Recovery</h2>
<p>So in September 2018 I found out, that my server where the <a href="https://123k.org">123k</a> project runs did not respond any more.
I went to the fabulous <a href="https://hetzner.de">Hetzner</a> site and found out, that it just does not boot
any more because of ZFS file system corruption.
This was not recoverable - I saved a snapshot of the whole thing. So if
some ZFS developer wants to know what happened to this special file system - you&rsquo;re welcome.
I myself did not investigate too much and just setup a new server (so I do <em>not</em> know if I was hacked or the underlying hypervisor had a hickup).</p>
<p>But unfortunately I really lost data.
The well curated descriptions of my bike rides for the whole 2018 season were lost.
I was able to recover the tracks itself from the raw
GPX data, but I ended up with <a href="https://123k.org/geo/routes/5bd6024c97882f6d4b16225d">several</a> <a href="https://123k.org/geo/routes/5bd6052e97882f6d4b16604e">tours</a> <a href="https://123k.org/geo/routes/5bd6057297882f6d4b166cea">with</a> <a href="https://123k.org/geo/routes/5bd604d697882f6d4b1652ab">placeholder</a> names and descriptions on the site. So just in case you wondered.</p>
<p>To bring you those news I wanted to write a blog post and noticed that my whole setup with
github-pages and <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> and everything encountered a severe version of bit-rot.</p>
<h2 id="welcome-hugo">Welcome Hugo</h2>
<p>So as the <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> project coincidentally also started a longer break (no relevant activity for the last three years)
I gave up&hellip;  and just 5 months later I found time to restart the whole blogging bullshit with the now popular <a href="https://hugo.io">Hugo</a>.</p>
<p>The content itself aged pretty good of course and the new tooling concept incorporates only one binary installed
via snap - so let&rsquo;s see how the next generator will be named :)</p>
<h2 id="wipu-quo-vadis">Wipu Quo Vadis?</h2>
<p>So apart from the way-point feature I did not add anything new to the site.
But I continued to really use and enjoy it. Especially because it really works.
Here are the top-features I use:</p>
<ul>
<li>I find (new) places I want to visit because of my coverage map.</li>
<li>I plan and execute geohashing campaigns (ok, to be fair - last year only one really)</li>
<li>I enjoy clicking through descriptions of old rides (embarrassing I know)</li>
</ul>
<p>So I think I will continue to support my site also in 2019. But to keep
things interesting (technically) I want to try one thing which grew upon me.
It really nags me every time I click on a route. I always ask myself, if it would be possible
to stream the track-points to show them incrementally on the map. This would provide a better
&lsquo;feeling&rsquo; for larger tracks for the existing use-cases and maybe could be a foundation to
build more experimental new use-cases on top of it
Something like running calculations which produce more points over a longer time because they are complicated
but could not be generated a priori like the coverage.</p>
