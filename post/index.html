<p>In the course of thel ast years all of my private sites and projects rotted away due to personal circumstances (I was to lazy and did not care).
So the only thing which seems to be operatable is the static homepage on 123k.pl and this also of course rotted away as nobody updated hugo for me.</p>
<p>So this fantastic elaborated blog-post marks the start of a new iteration.
The long term goal (which I should <em>never</em> write down here already now) is to have</p>

<p>A few years ago I bought my first few raspberries and the first thing I invented
was (of course) a thermometer application. Back then I even
stored the data in MongoDB and calculated stuff with map-reduce - but
as one rpi died and the host server also was re-installed I never looked back.</p>
<p>During my recent rebuild of the home-office I found some old rpis and even the thermometer
and the wireless sticks. So I thought I should start one of them again.</p>

<p>Hello there, I&rsquo;m <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldeerlh8_DA">Back in Business</a> (jak EPMD!) -
only after three years of effective inactivity I decided to re-active this blog again.
As I really did not prepare any content <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> , I can only start with some small notes.</p>
<h2 id="disaster-and-recovery">Disaster and Recovery</h2>
<p>So in September 2018 I found out, that my server where the <a href="https://123k.org">123k</a> project runs did not respond any more.
I went to the fabulous <a href="https://hetzner.de">Hetzner</a> site and found out, that it just does not boot
any more because of ZFS file system corruption.
This was not recoverable - I saved a snapshot of the whole thing. So if
some ZFS developer wants to know what happened to this special file system - you&rsquo;re welcome.
I myself did not investigate too much and just setup a new server (so I do <em>not</em> know if I was hacked or the underlying hypervisor had a hickup).</p>

      <h1 id="problem">Problem</h1>
<p>As seen in the <a href="https://123k.pl/post/build-a-coverage-map-with-mongodb/">post before</a>
we collected some 12.000 points which we want to display on a leaflet map.
Every attempt to put that many points on one map failed. Firefox completely stopped working, chrome did
a  little bit better and stayed responsive, but that was not a solution at all.</p>
<h1 id="solution">Solution</h1>
<p>I pretty much tried everything <code>L.geoJSON</code> layer with points and polygons.
Where polygons would have been a solution maybe, but you can not tell leaflet to just draw the corners of the polygons.
So I needed something else. In the <code>#leaflet</code> on freenode i was pointed to the
<a href="http://robertleeplummerjr.github.io/Leaflet.glify/">Leaflet.glify</a> project.</p>

<p>As mentioned <a href="https://123k.pl/post/build-a-coverage-map-with-mongodb/">earlier</a> I have all points i ever visited in a collection.
This collection holds a <a href="https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/applications/geospatial-indexes/">geospatial index</a>. Therefore I can issue mongo queries with
the <code>$nearSphere</code> command. This command finds the first points from a given location.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/efwe/c73ab0d887110156c2f9.js?file=first_route.rb"></script>


<p>So this just works. But what about other routes which may also be nice and just around the corner?
We can select many points around the hash point and check which routes they&rsquo;re on.</p>

<p>When I started with my personal bike-track homepage at <a href="https://123k.org">123k.org</a> a few years ago I decided to put all my tracks
in a MongoDB. The model I use is very simple. I have a class <code>Route</code> which holds meta-data about the track
and a class <code>TrackPoint</code> which represents a point and has a foreign key to the respective track (of course).
After some years I have 612827 track-points. So 600k entries is not &lsquo;big-data&rsquo; exactly,
but it is too much to be displayed on a leaflet map at once. What I really wanted is a &lsquo;Coverage View&rsquo;, which just
shows me where I&rsquo;ve been with the bike.</p>
